 Started the assignment by extracting the elements from poster2, using Illustrator. First I cleaned up the poster. Cleaned it free from all the elements that wasen't needed. Extracted the elements and exported to svg files. 
Started to make the poster and implementing the svg files. 
Struggeling to make the colored backgrounds with svg, started to make the backgrounds with css. 

The earth is made with svg path.
The svg persons, the green cloud, the car and the star are implemented with image element. 

In the "footer" it was decided to use justefy-content: space evenly, to make the content easier to read. 

I was a bit slow to answer the first message. I offered to split the work, but the other member suggested that she complete the first part of the code since she had already started. 

After the SVG elements was extracted, I used both viewBox and CSS to style them correctly in terms of positioning and size. I also animated the SVG using various types of animations, including CSS animations and SMIL animations. I used SMIL animation for the eyes on the moon and CSS animation for the people and the stars. I used these animation types since it was a part of the requierment and i knew how to use them.
